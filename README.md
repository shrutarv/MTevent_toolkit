# MTevent_Toolkit
Contains scrips to process and analyse the MTevent dataset.

The MTevent dataset is designed to advance event-based perception in dynamic environments. It addresses key challenges such as occlusions, varying lighting, extreme viewing angles, and long detection distances, providing a comprehensive benchmark for event-based vision across multiple tasksâ€”including 6D pose estimation of static and moving rigid objects, 2D motion segmentation, 3D bounding box detection, optical flow estimation, and object tracking. Annotations included in the dataset:
1. 6D pose of rigid objects.
2. 3D/2D bouding box coordinates of all moving objects.
